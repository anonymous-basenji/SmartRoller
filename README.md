An Android dice rolling app designed primarily for the board game Settlers of Catan.

Each number represents a pair of two individual dies, and you can roll up to two pairs at a time.

Additionally, you can scroll down to view gameplay stats (how many times each pair combination was rolled, what percentage of the time, etc.)
and view the history of your rolls, with the most recent roll being at the top of the list.
